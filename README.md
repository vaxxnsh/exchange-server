## ‚öôÔ∏è Trade Engine 

Manages Trades and handle orderbook logic for trades:

- Built around single-responsibility services in a class-based style.
- Core domain services: Orders, OrderBook, Balances, Snapshots.
- Auxiliary services: Market data formatting, error reporting, Redis integration.
- Outbound communication always flows through a unified Redis service.

## üì° Real-Time Websocket Server

The WebSocket layer provides a live connection between traders and the market:

- **Connection Pool:** Tracks all active client connections.
- **Session Sockets:** Maintain subscriptions and client state.
- **Channel Broker:** Bridges Redis Pub/Sub to connected clients.

**Workflow:**

- New connections are added to the Connection Pool.
- Client Connections register subscriptions via the Broker.
- The Broker listens for Redis Pub/Sub messages and dispatches updates to clients.

## üñ•Ô∏è User Interface

The UI is powered by Next.js and designed for speed + real-time interactivity:

- Server-side preloading for ticker/depth data.
- WebSocket manager handles live streams and subscriptions.
- Trading View charts to show kline data.
- Singleton Pattern for Handling Socket Logic.
